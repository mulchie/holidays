# Multi-Pitch Climbing at Donautal

## Schaufels

- [Normalweg](https://www.thecrag.com/de/klettern/germany/schwaebische-alb/donautal/route/249494217)
- [Ebinger Turm](https://www.thecrag.com/de/klettern/germany/schwaebische-alb/donautal/area/690915648)
  with [alternative topo](http://rocktopo.de/index.php/de/topos-de/21-topos-germany/schwaebische-alb/donautal/63-schaufels) that helped us a lot.
  - On the way up, within [one section, you actually have to climb down](https://www.hikr.org/gallery/photo1532431.html?post_id=84651#1).
    You should know how to do this, i.e., know about "dummy runner" or use "Munter Hitch / Crossing Hitch".
  - During Abseil, make sure you hit the correct belay station / stand.
    There is a rather new one with loose bolts you should avoid.
    And there are several [historic belay stations](https://www.hikr.org/gallery/photo1532440.html?post_id=84651#1) which you should avoid.
