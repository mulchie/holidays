# Multi-Pitch Climbing at Donautal

## Schaufels

### [Normalweg](https://www.thecrag.com/de/klettern/germany/schwaebische-alb/donautal/route/249494217)

Nice, but very heavily used and smooth.

You might be interested in this [alternative topo][alt_topo], which helped us a lot.
Two technical remarks:

- On the way up, within [one section, you actually have to climb down][down].
  You should know how to do this, i.e., know about "dummy runner" or use "Munter Hitch / Crossing Hitch".
- During Abseil, make sure you hit the correct belay station / stand.
  There is a rather new one with loose bolts you should avoid.
  And there are several [historic belay stations](https://www.hikr.org/gallery/photo1532440.html?post_id=84651#1) which you should avoid.
  The correct ones are marked on the [alternative topo][alt_topo].
  1. Top
  2. The one where you had to climb down from during your ascend
  3. Not the shiny loose one, not the historic one, but the one far lower down. Knot your rope!
