Amazing site and views.
We did not manage to find sector B.

Locals drive their cars through a disused tunnel to get to the old Ponale road and park right at the start of the hiking trail.
If you follow the climbing guides advice, you will park your car on a parking site next to the road and walk on a busy small road back towards the tunnel.
This is quite dangerous.
If your group is larger, think about driving your group directly to the hiking trail and parking your car afterwards.
This will reduce the number of people in dangerous situations on the road.
