# Ski Slope Tour Davos (1540)

New casual hotel in an prestigeous old house - [Hotel National](https://www.davosklostersmountains.ch/de/hotels/uebersicht/Hotel-National_a_32).
Arrived by train 🚆: KA -> Basel -> Landquart -> Davos Platz.

## Jakobshorn (2590) [^1]

After an early start before the ski slopes opened, we started from Davos Platz, eagerly passing the lower part of the ski slope to reach a large plateau.
The snow plateau, already riddled with tracks but still perfectly suitable,
is bordered by pistes and a cable car offers well-padded skiers a comfortable view of ascending contemporaries.

At the summit, non-alcoholic beer and chips could be savoured amid glistening sunshine with breathtaking views of the ski circus - just the thing.
The snow park was manned by masters (in direct sequence of two jumps: backflip followed by frontflip), and it was well worth watching!
The descent on the piste, peppered with a few runaways into the snowy plateau, was first class.
All in all, it was a fantastic day on the mountain followed by sauna sessions.

## Strelapass (2350) [^1]

The initial ascent from Davos Platz to the Strela cable car station was made in ski boots so that we could experience this for ourselves.
The ascent to the Strela Pass itself was on ski slopes that were still closed but already perfectly groomed.
Caution was advised when leaving the groomed piste areas in the Strela Pass area.
Some Swiss skiers were travelling off-piste and changed their choice of route
immediately after a not inconsiderable part of the snow slope fell away in the midday sun
just a few minutes before the planned ascent.
